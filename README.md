## Description
This is a Vue.js boilerplate project that provides a basic setup for building web applications using Vue.js. It includes the necessary configuration files and dependencies to get started with Vue.js development quickly and easily.
It has some of my go to packages and configurations that I use in most of my projects:
- [Custom CSS with variables]
- [Error Page]
- [Vue Sweet Alert 2]
